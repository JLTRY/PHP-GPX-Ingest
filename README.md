PHP-GPX-Ingest
==============

PHP GPX-Ingest is a simple PHP class designed to ingest a basic Global Position eXchange (GPX) file and extract data/stats from the tracks within. It's been tested with the GPX files output by the Android app SpeedView.

Documentation and example usage can be found in [the class documentation on my website](http://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/development-programming/222-php-gpx-ingest).
